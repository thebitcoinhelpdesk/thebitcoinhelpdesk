												<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
											</header>

											<h3>Bitcoin Security</h3>
											<p>Bitcoin ownership is determined by ownership of private keys. Anyone in the world with access to private keys has full control over the corresponding Bitcoin.

												<ul>
													<li>NEVER share your private keys with anyone unless you trust them will full control over your Bitcoin</li>
													<li>NEVER enter your private keys into a computer</li>
													<li>NEVER expose your keys in front of a camera</li>
													<li>NEVER speak your private keys out loud within range of a microphone</li>
												</ul>
											
											<p>Mike will NEVER ask for the private keys to your Bitcoin and will NEVER need access to your private keys to provide consulting. Sensitive operations involving private keys will be handled securely by you out of range of cameras and microphones and typically on dedicated secure hardware devices detached from your computer and the internet. You remain in full control of your Bitcoin at all times.</p>
											
											<p>If your private keys are ever exposed inadvertently during a consulting session, Mike will guide you through creating a new wallet with new private keys and transferring your Bitcoin to that new wallet.</p>

											<h3>Bitcoin Volatility</h3>

											<p>In the short term, Bitcoin price action can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Over the long term, Bitcoin has a proven 15-year record of being one of the best performing asset classes. Mike's guidance is best suited for low time preference individuals looking to build a nest egg for their future.</p>

											<h3>Liability</h3>

											<p>Mike does not offer financial, legal, or tax services. For financial or tax advice, consult a finance or tax professional.</p>

											<h3>Privacy</h3>

											<p>You remain in full control over how much information you reveal during consultations. Anonymous names and email addresses may be used during scheduling, and turning on your camera during calls is optional. Consulting sessions are NOT recorded. Payments must be made in Bitcoin to preserve privacy. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

											<p>Bitcoin security involves tradeoffs between cost, complexity, and usability. A general estimate of the percentage of your net worth you're looking to save in Bitcoin as well as your general risk tolerance are important factors in determining the appropriate guidance so may be discussed during the consultation.</p>

											<p>If screen sharing is necessary to facilitate software setup and troubleshooting, you remain in full control of what is shared.</p>
