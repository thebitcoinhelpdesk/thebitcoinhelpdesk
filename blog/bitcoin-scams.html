												<h2>Bitcoin Scams</h2>
											</header>

											<h3>Bitcoin ATMs</h3>
											<p>At best, legitimate Bitcoin ATMs often charge exorbitant fees sometimes upwards of 20% or more. At worst, compromised ATMs will just steal your money.</p>

											<p>Protect yourself from these scams by:</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Buy Bitcoin at reputable exchanges</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Compromised Key Generators and Wallets</h3>
											<p>Backing up the private keys to your wallets won't help you if the keys aren't generated and handled securely. Using anything other than offline, secure, reputable hardware devices that specialize in key management introduces significant risk of loss and theft.</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Malware or keyloggers may steal keys displayed or entered into an internet-connected computer</li>
												<li>Software supply chain attacks may infiltrate reputable software with malicious clones that will sweep funds</li>
												<li>Software bugs may result in keys that are easy to brute force as was shown with the <a href="https://milksad.info/">Milk Sad Disclosure</a></li>
											</ul>

											<p>Protect yourself from these scams by:</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Always use secure hardware wallets to manage private keys</li>
												<li>Always verify receive and change addresses on hardware wallets</li>
												<li>Disable auto-update of sensitive apps and verify all updates before installing them</li>
											</ul>											

											<h3>Deep Fake Ads Promising Free Bitcoin</h3>
											<p>Deep fakes are AI generated videos that can simulate facial patterns and speech patterns of an individual in a realistic way and superimpose those simulations onto an existing video of the individual to make it look and sound like they're saying things that they never said. Scammers are using deep fakes of respected Bitcoiners like Michael Saylor to publish ads suggesting that you can double your Bitcoin by sending Bitcoin to a specific address. Once you send the Bitcoin, that Bitcoin is lost forever.</p>

											<p>Protect yourself from these scams by:</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Never send Bitcoin to anyone promising free Bitcoin</li>
												<li>Report any malicious ads you encounter</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>High Yield Savings Instruments Where You Don't Control the Keys</h3>
											<p>Anyone offering high interest rate of return if you custody Bitcoin with them is likely rehypothecating your funds in a high risk way. The nominal interest rate you are promised is never enough to offset the risk you assume by relinquishing control of your Bitcoin. If the provider becomes insolvent like BlockFi, Celsius, and FTX in the past, your funds are likely lost forever.</p>

											<p>Protect yourself from these scams by:</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Buy and hold Bitcoin for the long term in cold storage</li>
												<li>Never relinquish control of your keys in any financial services arrangement</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Phishing Attacks</h3>
											<p>Scammers may send emails or call you on the phone under false pretenses and request that you send Bitcoin to an address they provide. Often these engagements are designed to look, feel, and sound like legitimate communications from reputable companies, relatives, utility providers, or other trustworthy sources.</p>

											<p>Protect yourself from these scams by:</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Always question anyone requiring immediate payment for anything unsolicited</li>
												<li>Never reveal any potentially compromising information about yourself or your finances</li>
												<li>Never click on any links or install any recommended software within the suspicious communications</li>
												<li>Always verify communications with the supposed source through independent channels</li>
											</ul>
