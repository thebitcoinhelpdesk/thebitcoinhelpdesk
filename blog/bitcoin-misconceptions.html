												<h2>Bitcoin Misconceptions</h2>
											</header>

											<h3>Bitcoin Is A Ponzi Scheme</h3>
											<p>Ponzi schemes generally require a central authority that convinces early adopters to scam later adopters out of their money for no value. Bitcoin has no central authority and is an equal opportunity sound monetary network available to all. With Bitcoin's limited supply and appeal as sound money, its price is expected to rise as adoption grows and demand increases. While early adopters who take on greater risk and volatility generally should expect greater returns than later adopters, all adopters receive the benefit of sound money, stable purchasing power, and financial self-sovereignty regardless of when they adopt.</p>

											<h3>Bitcoin Has No Utility</h3>
											<p>Bitcoin's primary utility is as a sound monetary good that functions as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account on top of a digital, decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant network. Additionally, many use cases are being developed on top of Bitcoin and its Layer 2 networks such as digital record timestamping and verification, tokenization of assets, streaming micro-payments, and others yet to be imagined.</p>

											<h3>Bitcoin Isn't Backed By Anything</h3>
											<p>Gold isn't backed by anything other than its scarcity and its utility. Not only is Bitcoin more scarce than gold and has more utility (see above), Bitcoin's security is backed by cryptography, mathematics, and the energy expended by miners to secure the network.</p>

											<h3>Bitcoin Isn't Scarce If It Can Be Copied</h3>
											<p>While the nature of open source software is that anyone can copy it, what can't be copied are Bitcoin's decentralized inception, first mover advantage, network effects, and developer community. Copying Bitcoin is only effective if everyone invested in Bitcoin agrees to migrate to the new network. Additionally, Bitcoin for all its merits will continue to attract and retain top talent which will further solidify its competitive advantage over any clones.</p>

											<h3>Bitcoin Can Be Shut Down By The Government</h3>
											<p>Bitcoin's decentralized, international, peer-to-peer nature makes it impossible for any one government to shut it down. While a government can make it more difficult for its citizens to buy and sell it through its traditional banking systems, it can not shut it down. In the history of money, wealth generally flows to the soundest money available. Those who choose not to adopt it will witness their wealth transfer to those who do, and governments should generally be incentivized to keep wealth within their borders.</p>

											<h3>Bitcoin Needs To Be Legal Tender To Be Money</h3>
											<p>In truly free markets, people can trade with whatever monetary goods both buyer and seller agree upon. Argentina's Libertarian President and Austrian Economist Javier Milei demonstrated this in December 2023 by implementing a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/argentinas-minister-of-foreign-affairs-affirms-bitcoin-acceptance-for-contract-agreements">freedom of currency policy</a> that allowed any monetary good to be used in contract agreements, including Bitcoin.</p>

											<h3>Bitcoin Is Too Expensive</h3>
											<p>While the market price of 1 Bitcoin can appear as a steep barrier to entry for many, 1 Bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 units and can be purchased in these fractional amounts. $10 of Bitcoin can be purchased just as easily as $10,000 regardless of the market price of 1 Bitcoin.</p>
